# Hi! 👋
Tabletop controls are all about making your Warhammer 40K experience go as smoothly as possible. Tired of rolling dice? We have auto-roll. Wanna keep track of your units? We got you!

# A little bit of back story!
Recently I was interest in the Warhammer 40k tabletop game. During one instance, I had to roll 30 dice to save my units (btw they all failed), which inspired me to make this app.
